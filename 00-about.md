The Des Moines Web Collective is a collaborative, community-driven resource focused on bringing together web design and development professionals in the Des Moines metro area.

This is a place to:

- Meet fellow web professionals
- Discover new groups and organizations
- Learn about upcoming events
- Share resources
- Post or find job openings

This site is an all-in-one resource for all things web design and development in central Iowa. At its most basic level, the Des Moines Web Collective is a community, existing both online and offline, connecting like-minded professionals. As a collaborative resource, its continued success relies on you to help maintain, add and remove content - including groups, events, jobs and resources.

Join the Des Moines Web Collective and help solidify the Des Moines metro's place as a technology and innovation hub in the Midwest.

Thank you for your interest and support.
